# Prompt Writing

Before writing a prompt, get to know the user with the `astria` CLI (see the
`astria-api` skill):

- `astria prompts list --limit 20` — their recent prompts, to learn their style and parameters.
- `astria packs list` — their packs. If the request is about a specific subject (e.g. a shirt), find a pack whose `main_class_name` matches and inspect its template prompts with `astria prompts list --pack-id <id>`.
- `astria tunes list` — their references/tunes. If any match what they want to generate, reference it in the prompt via `<model_type:id:1> name` syntax (see the `astria-api` skill).

Do not send the user off to browse packs or tunes themselves — query with the
CLI and bring concrete suggestions back to them. When offering choices, your
ask-user question tool (`AskUserQuestion` in Claude Code, `ask_user` in the
Astria chat agent) with image thumbnails helps them pick.

If no tune matches the request, follow intent:
- For headshots / models / avatars, do NOT ask for a reference first. Propose ready-to-generate prompt options and trait options (look, age range, styling, framing, lighting), then confirm generation settings.
- For product or person-specific identity requests where likeness matters, ask the user to provide a reference image (upload it as a tune with `astria tunes create`, or drag it into the prompt box in the web app).
- Do not suggest web search for this flow.

After writing a prompt, show the user the prompt text and let them review or
edit it before generating. Confirm how many images per prompt (via an
ask-user question) before calling `astria generate`.

# Types of request

1. **E-commerce / product shots** — reference tunes to create a new image.
2. **Image editing** — pass `astria generate --input-image <url|file>` to modify an existing image (change background, change style, add/remove objects).
3. **Upscaling** — `astria generate --model gemini --text "Recreate this image in 4K" --input-image <url>`. If the image has prominent text labels, mention them in the prompt so they survive the upscale.

# Prompt Writing Guide

By default generate with the **gemini** model (`astria generate --model gemini`).
No need to ask the user about model type unless they explicitly mention another
one or ask for a recommendation.

## Default intent mapping

If the user asks to create "models", "avatars", or "headshots", interpret this
as a request for realistic, unique face headshots on a clean white studio
background:
- Do not use any reference tune for this request type.
- Keep framing as a face headshot (not full body), white `#fff` studio backdrop, studio lighting.
- Proactively offer prompt/trait choices with an ask-user question instead of asking for references.
- Treat nationality words ("israeli", "french", "japanese") as styling/trait guidance for facial features and casting diversity, not as a request for references.
- Do NOT suggest fashion, lookbook, lifestyle, full-body, or outfit-led prompts for this request type unless the user explicitly asks for those.

See the `unique-headshot` skill for the detailed face-trait template.

## Interaction rule (strict)

Never ask a question and suggest prompt text in the same response.
- If you use the ask-user question tool, return only questions/options in that turn.
- After the user answers, return the prompt suggestion(s) in the next turn.

## References

For a reference tune always use `<model_type:tune.id:1> tune.name` to reference
the trained subject:
- `portrait of <faceid:123:1> woman in a garden wearing <faceid:124:1> dress` — CORRECT
- `portrait of John in a garden` — WRONG (the model doesn't know "John")

The trailing `:1` is a fixed part of the token syntax — it is NOT a weight or
strength. Always write `:1`; never vary it, and never tell a user to change it.

## Reviewing bad results

If the user says results are bad, figure out what went wrong:
1. Inspect each reference's `orig_images` (`astria tunes get <id>`) and check the `name` matches the image content. If `name=woman` but the image is a full-body shot including clothes or a hat, tell the user to re-crop the training images on that tune's page (`/tunes/<id>` → "training images" → crop tool).
2. The `name` must represent the main subject. "jewelry" is a poor name — it should be "ring" or "necklace" depending on the subject. If a tune named "jewelry" holds a ring, suggest renaming it (`astria tunes update <id> --name ring`) and retraining.
3. Distorted or competing faces (e.g. a LoRA and a FaceID of the same person in one prompt): turn on "Inpaint faces" in the composer settings, or remove the extra face reference (✕ on its chip). Do NOT suggest adjusting the numbers inside reference tokens — there is no reference-weight control.

## Key parameters

| Parameter | CLI flag | Common values |
|-----------|----------|---------------|
| Prompt text | `--text` | Required |
| Number of images | `--num-images` | 1–4 |
| Aspect ratio | `--aspect-ratio` | `1:1 16:9 9:16 21:9 9:21 3:2 2:3 5:4 4:5 4:3` |
| Resolution (gemini only) | `--resolution` | `1K`, `2K` (default), `4K` |

## Tips for better results

- Include background descriptions: "clean white studio", "blurred urban street", "autumn forest".
- For product shots, describe the surface and arrangement.

## Keeping the background identical across generations

Gemini / Nano Banana does not hold a backdrop exactly from one generation to
the next — the shade and brightness of a studio background drift even when a
background reference is attached. Wording cannot fix this; the reliable fix is
the post-processing flag, appended to the prompt text:

```
astria generate --text "<faceid:123:1> woman in a studio --background_color #f2f0ed"
```

`--background_color #RRGGBB` recolors the detected background to that exact hex
after generation, so a whole catalog lands on the same backdrop. It runs on
Gemini / Nano Banana, partner models and Kontext — not on Flux. In the web app
it is the "Background color" row in the composer's options cog.

Two related mistakes to check when a user reports a drifting background:

- Text like "match the provided background reference" with no background
  reference actually attached — the model then invents a backdrop every run.
  Attach it as a reference (`<faceid:ID:1> background`) or describe the exact
  colour instead.
- Five or six references stacked in one prompt (subject + outfit + shoes + hat
  + bag + background). They compete, and the background gives way first — keep
  the essentials and add accessories in a second pass.

# Fashion and garments

1. Always work with a consistent face reference. If the user has none, suggest a faceid tune from the public gallery (`astria tunes list --gallery --model-type faceid --limit 200`) or generate a face first (no reference) and convert one of those outputs into a tune with `astria tunes create`.
2. Figure out the intent — a lookbook (e.g. prompt `look book plain white background #fff`) or a campaign shot. Campaign example: `A direct flash paparazzi style shot of <faceid:3904080:1> woman moving through a crowded bar. She looks straight into the lens with an intense expression. She wears the <faceid:3907553:1> dress and the <faceid:3907242:1> bag on her shoulder. The background is dark and out of focus. High contrast, sharp flash.`
