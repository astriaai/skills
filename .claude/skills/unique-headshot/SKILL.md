# Unique Headshot Generator

Generate realistic, unique face headshots for AI model creation. No reference tune needed — the prompt itself defines the face through detailed physical trait descriptions.

Close-up studio headshot of a [age]-year-old [ethnicity/heritage] [gender] with [skin_tone] skin, [skin_details], [eye_description], [nose_description], [face_structure], [unique_feature], [hair_description]. Bare shoulders, no clothing visible, no jewelry. [expression], looking at the camera. Clean white background #fff, [lighting], natural realistic skin detail, beauty headshot
```

### Lighting
Vary lighting for natural diversity:
- soft ring light

## Generation Rules

1. **No reference tunes** — these prompts generate entirely new faces
2. **Always use $GEMINI_TUNE_ID** as the model
3. **Default parameters**: num_images=2, resolution="2K", aspect_ratio="1:1"
4. **Never repeat the same ethnicity/heritage** in a batch
5. **Every prompt must have at least one unique distinguishing feature** (scar, dimple, beauty mark, asymmetry, etc.)
6. **Hair is always pulled back** — no hair framing or covering the face
7. **Fixed suffix**: `Bare shoulders, no clothing visible, no jewelry. [expression], looking at the camera. Clean white background #fff, [lighting], natural realistic skin detail, beauty headshot`
8. **No photographer references or magazine names** in the prompt — keep it clean and generic

## Batch Generation

When generating multiple unique headshots, maximize diversity:
- Vary ethnicity, skin tone, eye color, face shape, and unique features across the batch
- Alternate between single-origin and mixed-heritage backgrounds
- Mix age range (don't make them all the same age)
- Vary expressions and lighting setups
- Each face should be immediately distinguishable from the others
